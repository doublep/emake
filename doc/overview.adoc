== Brief overview

Eldev features:

* Eldev configuration is Elisp.  It can change many defaults, add
  special cases for Emacs versions and much more — even define
  additional Eldev commands and options.
* Built-in <<testing,support for regression/unit testing>>.
* Blends nicely into <<continuous-integration,continuous
  integration>> setups.
* Can run on <<different-emacs-versions,different Emacs version>> even
  on the same machine; can also use <<docker,Docker>> or
  <<podman,Podman>> for that.
* There are <<setup-procedure,four levels of configuration>> — you can
  customize most aspects of Eldev for your project needs and personal
  preferences.
* <<dependencies,Project dependency>> downloading, installation etc.
  is fully automated, you only need to tell the tool where to find
  them:
** <<package-archives,in package archives>> (MELPA, GNU ELPA, etc.);
** <<vc-repositories,in VC (Git) repositories>>;
** <<local-sources,in a local directory on your machine>> (this is
   similar to Cask linking, but with more flexibility).
* Full support for <<autoloads,autoloads>> during development.
* Miscellaneous operations useful during development:
  <<running-emacs,running Emacs>> with only your project,
  <<linting,linting>> source code, <<evaluating,evaluating
  expressions>> in project’s context, <<profiling,profiling>>.
* Can <<maintainer-plugin,automate release process>> for your project.
* Eldev by default <<project-isolation,isolates>> your project for
  development, helping you to distinguish between problems with setup
  or configuration and inherent bugs in the project.
* Full-featured <<build-system,build system>> for complex projects.
* Can <<debugging-features,help you debug your code>>.
* <<requirements,Runs on all major operating systems>>: Linux, macOS,
  Windows.
* Eldev is fast.

Drawbacks:

* Eldev doesn’t run the project being tested/built in a separate
  process, so it is not as pure as Cask.  However, Emacs packages
  won’t live in a sterile world anyway: typical user setup will
  include dozens of other packages.
* Eldev depends much more on Emacs internals.  It is more likely to
  break with future Emacs versions than Cask.

Eldev is not widely used, but as of August 2022 there are
{uri-search-github}[around 120 projects on GitHub] that include file
`Eldev`, so it is already quite well tested in the wild.
Additionally, Eldev contains a fairly large regression test
collection.

TIP: If you are using {uri-flycheck}[Flycheck] or
{uri-flymake}[Flymake], check out {uri-flycheck-eldev}[flycheck-eldev]
or, correspondingly, {uri-flymake-eldev}[flymake-eldev] package.  They
provide integration between Flycheck/Flymake and Eldev, allowing the
former to automatically use proper dependencies in Eldev projects.

=== Example projects

Here is a non-exhaustive list of projects that use Eldev and can serve
as examples.  I intentionally list only my own projects, even if there
are others, because this way it’s easier to ensure that the comments
below stay valid.  Eldev source code itself comes with no examples: I
think real-world usage provides better models.

{uri-extmap}[`extmap`]; its file {uri-extmap}/blob/master/Eldev[`Eldev`]; its file {uri-extmap}/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml[`.github/workflows/test.yml`]::

    A simple project with no dependencies.  As you can see, there is
    nothing in its `Eldev`.  The file is actually not even needed, it
    is only there to signify that Eldev can be used on the project and
    for some tools ({uri-flycheck-eldev}[flycheck-eldev],
    {uri-flymake-eldev}[flymake-eldev], {uri-projectile}[Projectile]).

{uri-iter2}[`iter2`]; its file {uri-iter2}/blob/master/Eldev[`Eldev`]; its file {uri-iter2}/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml[`.github/workflows/test.yml`]::

    Another simple project with no dependencies.  However, it uses its
    file `Eldev` to define a custom option that activates
    project-specific development assistance code.  Additionally, it
    enables <<undercover-plugin,undercover>> plugin to collect test
    code coverage statistics.

{uri-logview}[Logview]; its file {uri-logview}/blob/master/Eldev[`Eldev`]; its file {uri-logview}/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml[`.github/workflows/test.yml`]::

    This project has several dependencies, so it needs to instruct
    Eldev how to find them.

{uri-datetime}[`datetime`]; its file {uri-datetime}/blob/master/Eldev[`Eldev`]; its file {uri-datetime}/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml[`.github/workflows/test.yml`]::

    A library with a fairly complicated file `Eldev`.  The main reason
    for complexity are two included Java programs that are used for 1)
    extracting information from Java core libraries; and 2) comparing
    ``datetime``’s results against a Java implementation during
    testing.  It also uses `extmap` to generate resource files that
    are later included in its package.

All these projects also use <<continuous-integration,continuous
integration>> on <<github-workflows,GitHub>> for automated testing.
Various elements of files `Eldev` in these projects are documented
below.

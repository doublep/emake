Eldev (Elisp development tool) is an Emacs-based build tool, targeted
solely at Elisp projects.  It is an alternative to Cask.  Unlike Cask,
Eldev itself is fully written in Elisp and its configuration files are
also Elisp programs.  If you are familiar with Java world, Cask can be
seen as a parallel to Maven — it uses project _description_, while
Eldev is sort of a parallel to Gradle — its configuration is a
_program_ on its own.

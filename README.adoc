Eldev (Elisp Development Tool) is an Emacs-based build tool, targeted
solely at Elisp projects.  It is an alternative to Cask.  Unlike Cask,
Eldev itself is fully written in Elisp and its configuration files are
also Elisp programs.  If you are familiar with Java world, Cask can be
seen as a parallel to Maven — it uses project _description_, while
Eldev is sort of a parallel to Gradle — its configuration is a
_program_ on its own.

toc::[]


== Brief overview

Eldev features:

* Eldev configuration is Elisp.  It can change many defaults or even
  define additional commands and options.
* Built-in support for regression/unit testing.
* There are _four_ levels of configuration — you can customize most
  aspects of Eldev for your project needs and personal preferences.
* You can use local dependencies, even those that don’t use Eldev
  (though some restrictions do apply, of course).  This is similar to
  Cask linking, but with more flexibility.
* Eldev is fast.

Drawbacks:

* Eldev doesn’t run the project being tested/built in a separate
  process, so it is not as pure as Cask.  However, Emacs packages
  won’t live in a sterile world anyway: typical user setup will
  include dozens of other packages.
* Eldev depends much more on Emacs internals.  It is more likely to
  break with future Emacs versions than Cask.

Eldev is not widely used, but as of April 2021 there are
{uri-search-github}[around 50 projects on GitHub] that include file
`Eldev`, so it is quite well tested in the wild.  Additionally, Eldev
contains a fairly large regression test collection.

TIP: If you are using {uri-flycheck}[Flycheck], check out
{uri-flycheck-eldev}[flycheck-eldev] package.  It provides integration
between Flycheck and Eldev, allowing the former to automatically use
proper dependencies in Eldev projects.

=== Example projects

Here is a non-exhaustive list of projects that use Eldev and can serve
as examples.  I intentionally list only my own projects, even if there
are others, because this way it’s easier to ensure that the comments
below stay valid.  Eldev source code itself comes with no examples: I
think real-world usage provides better models.

{uri-extmap}[`extmap`]; its file {uri-extmap}/blob/master/Eldev[`Eldev`]; its file {uri-extmap}/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml[`.github/workflows/test.yml`]::

    A simple project with no dependencies.  As you can see, there is
    nothing in its `Eldev`.  The file is actually not even needed, it
    is only there to signify that Eldev can be used on the project and
    for some tools ({uri-flycheck-eldev}[flycheck-eldev],
    {uri-projectile}[Projectile]).

{uri-iter2}[`iter2`]; its file {uri-iter2}/blob/master/Eldev[`Eldev`]; its file {uri-iter2}/blob/master/.travis.yml[`.travis.yml`]::

    Another simple project with no dependencies.  However, it uses its
    file `Eldev` to define a custom option that activates
    project-specific development assistance code.  Additionally, it
    enables <<undercover-plugin,undercover>> plugin to collect test
    code coverage statistics.

{uri-logview}[Logview]; its file {uri-logview}/blob/master/Eldev[`Eldev`]; its file {uri-logview}/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml[`.github/workflows/test.yml`]::

    This project has several dependencies, so it needs to instruct
    Eldev how to find them.  Additionally, it deactivates (i.e. makes
    it do nothing even if specified) one option provided by Eldev,
    because of what seems like a bug in Emacs 24.

{uri-datetime}[`datetime`]; its file {uri-datetime}/blob/master/Eldev[`Eldev`]; its file {uri-datetime}/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml[`.github/workflows/test.yml`]::

    A library with a fairly complicated file `Eldev`.  The main reason
    for complexity are two included Java programs that are used for 1)
    extracting information from Java core libraries; and 2) comparing
    ``datetime``’s results against a Java implementation during
    testing.  It also uses `extmap` to generate resource files that
    are later included in its package.

All these projects also use <<continuous-integration,continuous
integration>> on either <<github-workflows,GitHub>> or
<<travis-ci,Travis CI>> for automated testing.  Various elements of
files `Eldev` in these projects are documented below.


== Requirements

Eldev runs on Emacs 24.4 and up.  On earlier Emacs versions it will be
overly verbose, but this is rather an Emacs problem.

Linux, macOS or other POSIX-like system is currently required.
However, since there is only a small shell script that is really
OS-dependent, porting to other systems should not be difficult
(volunteers welcome).

Eldev intentionally has no dependencies, at least currently: otherwise
your project would also see them, which could in theory lead to some
problems.

== Installation

There are several ways to install Eldev.

[discrete]
==== Bootstrapping from MELPA: if you have a catch-all directory for executables
--
* On Unix, from this directory (e.g. `~/bin`) execute:
+
    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/bin/eldev > eldev && chmod a+x eldev

* On Windows, from this directory (e.g. `%USERPROFILE%\bin`) execute:
+
    $ curl.exe -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/bin/eldev.bat > eldev.bat

You can even do this from `/usr/local/bin` provided you have the
necessary permissions.
--

No further steps necessary — Eldev will bootstrap itself as needed on
first invocation.

[discrete]
==== Bootstrapping from MELPA: general case

===== Unix

. Execute:
+
--
    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/webinstall/eldev | sh

This will install `eldev` script to `~/.eldev/bin`.
--

. Add the directory to your `$PATH`; e.g. in `~/.profile` add this:
+
      export PATH="$HOME/.eldev/bin:$PATH"

===== Windows

. Execute:
+
--
    $ curl.exe -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/webinstall/eldev.bat | cmd

This will install `eldev.bat` script to `%USERPROFILE%\.eldev\bin`.
--

. Add the directory to your `%PATH%`:
+
      reg add HKCU\Environment /v Path /d "%USERPROFILE%\.eldev\bin;%PATH%" /f


Afterwards Eldev will bootstrap itself as needed on first invocation.

TIP: `eldev` doesn’t _really_ need to be findable through `$PATH` — it
will work regardless.  This is rather for your convenience, so that
you don’t need to type the full path again and again.


[discrete]
==== Installing from sources

. Clone the source tree from GitHub.

. In the cloned working directory execute:
+
--
    $ ./install.sh DIRECTORY

Here `DIRECTORY` is the location of `eldev` executable should be put.
It should be in `$PATH` environment variable, or else you will need to
specify full path each time you invoke Eldev.  You probably have
sth. like `~/bin` in your `$PATH` already, which would be a good value
for `DIRECTORY`.  You could even install in e.g. `/usr/local/bin` —
but make sure you have permissions first.
--

[discrete]
==== Mostly for developing Eldev itself

. Clone the source tree from GitHub.

. Set environment variable `$ELDEV_LOCAL` to the full path of the
  working directory.

. Make sure executable `eldev` is available.  Either follow any of the
  first way to install Eldev, or symlink/copy file `bin/eldev` from
  the cloned directory to somewhere on your `$PATH`.

Now each time Eldev is executed, it will use the sources at
`$ELDEV_LOCAL`.  You can even modify it and see how that affects Eldev
immediately.

=== Upgrading Eldev

Eldev bootstraps itself when needed, but won’t automatically fetch new
versions.  To upgrade it later, explicitly run (from any directory):

    $ eldev upgrade-self

By default it uses MELPA Stable.  If you want to test or use some not
yet officially released version, try:

    $ eldev --unstable upgrade-self

This will make it use MELPA Unstable for upgrading.  If you want to
switch back to the latest stable version (as recommended), supply `-d`
(`--downgrade`) option to the command:

    $ eldev upgrade-self -d


== Safety concerns

TIP: In general, it is not recommended to execute Eldev, GNU Make,
Scons, any other build tool or anything based on one in a directory
that contains untrusted code.

Like many (if not most) other development tools, Eldev is unsafe when
executed on untrusted code.  For example, simply running `eldev` in a
project you have just downloaded from `hackerden.org` can result in
anything, including emptied home directory.  For that matter, running
`make` or `gradle` is not better in this regard.  Eldev is perhaps _a
bit_ more dangerous, because even `eldev help` reads file `Eldev`,
thus executing arbitrary code.

Even seemingly harmless things, like opening a `.el` file in Emacs can
lead to unforeseen consequences.  If you e.g. have
{uri-flycheck}[Flycheck] enabled everywhere, this will result in
byte-compiling said file, which also can execute arbitrary code, for
example using `(eval-when-compile ...)` form.  The same holds for
installing (not even using!) Elisp packages.

Only use build tools on code that you trust.  Better yet, don’t even
touch code that you don’t plan running.


== Getting started

Eldev comes with built-in help.  Just run:

    $ eldev help

This will list all the commands Eldev supports.  To see detailed
description of any of those, type:

    $ eldev help COMMAND

In the help you can also see lots of options — both global and
specific to certain commands.  Many common things are possible just
out of the box, but <<extending-eldev,later we will discuss>> how to
define additional commands and options or change defaults for the
existing.

Two most important global options to remember are `--trace` (`-t`) and
`--debug` (`-d`).  With the first one, Eldev prints lots of additional
information about what it is doing to stdout.  With the second, Eldev
prints stacktraces for most errors.  These options will often help you
figure out what’s going wrong without requesting any external
assistance.  Also check out section on <<debugging-features,various
debugging features>> discussed later.

Eldev mostly follows GNU conventions in its command line.  Perhaps the
only exception is that global options must be specified before command
name and command-specific options — after it.


== Initializing a project

When Eldev starts up, it configures itself for the project in the
directory where it is run from.  This is done by loading Elisp file
called `Eldev` (without extension!) in the current directory.  This
file is similar to Make’s `Makefile` or Cask’s `Cask`.  But even more
so to Gradle’s `build.gradle`: because it is a program.  File `Eldev`
is not strictly required, but nearly all projects will have one.  It
is also generally recommended to create it even if empty, because
otherwise some tools (e.g. {uri-flycheck-eldev}[flycheck-eldev],
{uri-projectile}[Projectile]) will not recognize the project as
Eldev-based without it.

You can create the file in your project manually, but it is easier to
just let Eldev itself do it for you, especially the first time:

    $ eldev init

If you let the initializer do its work, it will create file `Eldev`
already prepared to download project dependencies.  If you answer “no”
to its question (or execute as `eldev init --non-interactive`), just
edit the created file and uncomment some of the calls to
`eldev-use-package-archive` there as appropriate.  These forms
instruct Eldev to use specific package archives to download project
dependencies.

After this step, Eldev is ready to work with your project.

[#setup-procedure]
== Setup procedure in details

Now that we have created file `Eldev`, it makes sense to go over the
full startup process:

* Load file `~/.eldev/config`
* Load file `Eldev` in the current directory
* Load file `Eldev-local` in the current directory
* Execute setup forms specified on the command line

None of these Elisp files and forms are required.  They are also not
restricted in what they do.  However, their _intended_ usage is
different.

File `~/.eldev/config` is _user-specific_.  It is meant mostly for
customizing Eldev to your personal preferences.  For example, if you
hate coloring of Eldev output, add form `(setf eldev-coloring-mode
nil)` to it.  Then every Eldev process started for any project will
default to using uncolored output.

File `Eldev` is _project-specific_.  It is the only configuration file
that should be added to project’s VCS (Git, Mercurial, etc.).  Typical
usage of this file is to define in which package archives to look up
dependencies.  It is also the place to define project-specific
builders and commands, for example to build project documentation from
source.

File `Eldev-local` is _working directory_ or _user/project-specific_.
Unlike `Eldev`, it _should not_ be added to VCS: it is meant to be
created by each developer (should he want to do so) to customize how
Eldev behaves in this specific directory.  The most common use is to
define local dependencies.  A good practice is to instruct your VSC to
ignore this file, e.g. list it in `.gitignore` for Git.

Finally, it is possible to specify some (short) setup forms on the
command line using `--setup` (`-S`) option.  This is not supposed to
be used often, mostly in cases where you run Eldev on a use-once
project checkout, e.g. on a <<continuous-integration,continuous
integration>> server.

[#project-isolation]
=== Project isolation

Eldev tries to create a self-contained environment for building and
testing your project.  It will isolate your project as much as
possible from your “normal” Emacs, i.e. the one that you use for
editing.  This is done to avoid interference from your other installed
packages or configuration, to prevent broken and misbehaving projects
from affecting your Emacs and, finally, to simplify testing of certain
“permanent effect” features, like customizing variables.

* Packages installed in your Emacs (usually in `~/.emacs.d/elpa/`) are
  not visible for projects built with Eldev.  Likewise, dependencies
  installed for such projects will not appear in your normal Emacs.

* {since-0-2-1} Variable `user-emacs-directory` will point somewhere
  inside `.eldev` in the project’s directory rather than to
  `~/.emacs.d`.  This also means that `locate-user-emacs-file` will
  not find files in your normal configuration directory.  If you want
  to undo this change (e.g. in file `Eldev` or `Eldev-local`), use
  original value of the variable stored as
  `eldev-real-user-emacs-directory`.

* Eldev supports <<different-emacs-versions,executing on different
  Emacs version>> for the same project without any additional steps.

=== Using preinstalled dependencies

{since-0-8} Starting with version 0.8 you can opt out of some of the
default project isolation features and use preinstalled dependencies,
e.g. those from your normal Emacs.  To activate this mode, use global
option `--external` (`-X`), e.g.:

    $ eldev -X test

In this mode Eldev will expect dependencies to be installed in given
directory (standard Emacs location — `~/.emacs.d/elpa` — is only the
default: you can use another directory).  If a dependency is not
installed, Eldev _will not_ install it on its own: it doesn’t know
which package archives should be used.  Likewise, it will not upgrade
anything.  In all such cases, i.e. when required dependencies are not
correctly preinstalled in the specified external directory, Eldev will
simply fail.

<<local-dependencies,Local dependencies>> discussed later take
precedence even in this mode: anything declared as local will override
dependencies available from an external directory, just like it will
in usual full isolation mode.

This mode can be useful to load exactly the same dependency versions
as those installed in your normal Emacs.  However, it is not suitable
for continuous integration or for working on packages that you do not
have — for whatever reason — installed normally.  It is also difficult
to test on <<different-emacs-versions,different Emacs versions>> in
external directory mode.  Therefore, it is not the default.  But, as
usual in Eldev, you can make it the default in file `~/.eldev/config`
if you want.


== Project dependencies

Eldev picks up project dependencies from package declaration,
i.e. usually from `Package-Requires` header in the project’s main
`.el` file.  If you have several files with package headers in the the
root directory, you need to set variable `eldev-project-main-file`,
else function `package-dir-info` can pick a wrong one.  In any case,
you don’t need to declare these dependencies second time in `Eldev`
and keep track that they remain in sync.

However, you do need to tell Eldev how to _find_ these dependencies.
Like Cask, by default it doesn’t use any package archives.  To tell it
to use an archive, call function `eldev-use-package-archive` in
`Eldev` (you have such forms already in place if you have used `eldev
init`).  For example:

[source]
----
(eldev-use-package-archive 'melpa)
----

Eldev knows about two “standard” archives, which should cover most of
your needs: `gnu` and `melpa`.  When using MELPA, you can also
explicitly choose `melpa-stable` or `melpa-unstable` instead.

{since-0-5} A better way is provided by two global options: `--stable`
(the default) and `--unstable`.  Normally, Eldev will try to install
everything from MELPA Stable (you wouldn’t want your tests fail only
because a dependency in an unstable version has a bug).  However, if a
package is not available (at all or in the required version) from the
stable archive, unstable will be used automatically.  If you specify
`--unstable` on the command line, Eldev will behave in the opposite
way: prefer the unstable archive and use the stable only as a
fallback.

Emacs 25 and up supports package archive priorities.  Eldev backports
this to Emacs 24 and utilizes the feature to assign the standard
archives it knows about priorities 300 (for GNU ELPA), 200 and 100
(for MELPA Stable/Unstable).  A dependency from a package with a lower
priority is installed only if there are no other options.

If dependencies for your project are only available from some other
archive, you can still use the same function.  Just substite the
symbolic archive name with a cons cell of name and URL as strings:

[source]
----
(eldev-use-package-archive '("myarchive" . "http://my.archive.com/packages/"))
----

You don’t need to perform any additional steps to have Eldev actually
install the dependencies: any command that needs them will make sure
they are installed first.  However, if you want to check if package
archives have been specified correctly and all dependencies can be
looked up without problems, you can explicitly use command `prepare`.

[#local-dependencies]
=== Local dependencies

Imagine you are developing more than one project at once and they
depend on each other.  You’d typically want to test the changes you
make in one of them from another right away.  If you are familiar with
Cask, this is solved by linking projects in it.

Eldev provides a more flexible approach to this problem called _local
dependencies_.  Let’s assume you develop project `foo` in directory
`~/foo` and also a library called `barlib` in `~/barlib`.  And `foo`
uses the library.  To have Eldev use your local copy of `barlib`
instead of downloading it e.g. from MELPA, add the following form in
file `~/foo/Eldev-local`:

[source]
----
(eldev-use-local-dependency "~/barlib")
----

Note that the form _must not_ be added to `Eldev`: other developers
who check out your project probably don’t even have a local copy of
`barlib` or maybe have it in some other place.  In other words, this
should really remain your own private setting and go to `Eldev-local`.

Local dependencies have _loading modes_, just as the project’s package
itself.  Those will be discussed <<loading-modes,later>>.

Eldev correctly handles situations with changing definitions of local
dependencies.  I.e. by simply commenting out or uncommenting
`eldev-use-local-dependency` call, you can quickly test your project
both with a MELPA-provided package and with a local dependency — Eldev
will adapt without any additional work from you.

[#additional-dependencies]
=== Additional dependencies

It is possible to register additional dependencies for use only by
certain Eldev commands.  Perhaps the most useful is to make certain
packages available for testing purposes.  For example, if your project
doesn’t depend on package `foo` on its own, but your test files do,
add the following form to `Eldev` file:

[source]
----
(eldev-add-extra-dependencies 'test 'foo)
----

Additional dependencies are looked up in the same way as normal ones.
So, you need to make sure that all of them are available from the
package archives you instructed Eldev to use.

The following commands make use of additional dependencies: `build`,
`emacs`, `eval`, `exec` and `test`.  Commands you define yourself can
also take advantage of this mechanism, see function
`eldev-load-project-dependencies`.

[#extended-dependency-format]
==== Extended dependency format

{since-0-2} Normally to specify an additional dependency you just need
to provide its package name as a symbol.  However, Eldev also supports
“extended” format, that lets you specify other details.  In this
format, dependency is specified as a property list (plist):

[source]
----
(:package  DEPENDENCY-NAME
 :version  REQUIRED-VERSION
 :archive  PACKAGE-ARCHIVE
 :archives (PACKAGE-ARCHIVE...)
 :optional OPTIONAL)
----

All keywords except `:package` can be omitted.  In the extended format
you can specify which version of the dependency is required (normally,
any version will do) and which package archive(s) to use (by default,
the same archives as for normal dependencies are used).  In values
associated with `:archive`/`:archives` standard shortcuts `gnu` (for
GNU ELPA) and `melpa` (for MELPA; also `melpa-stable` and
`melpa-unstable`) can be used.  Dependencies can also be marked as
optional, see the next subsection.

{since-0-9} There is also a special format for referring to certain
tools like <<buttercup,Buttercup>>: `(:tool TOOL-NAME)`.  For details,
refer to section <<development-tool-sources,Development tool
sources>>.

==== Optional additional dependencies

{since-0-9} Suppose you want to test your project’s integration with a
third-party package, but don’t strictly _need_ it.  And, additionally,
relevant tests are written in such a way as to simply be skipped if
said package is not available, e.g. using `ert-skip` or
`buttercup-skip`.  In this case you may want to declare the package as
an _optional additional dependency_, so that you don't need to care if
it can be installed during continuous integration or not:

[source]
----
(eldev-add-extra-dependencies 'test '(:package helm :optional t))
----

In this example, we declare that we want Helm for testing, but don't
care much if it cannot be installed, e.g. because of too old Emacs
version.

=== Examining dependencies

Sometimes it is useful to check what a project depends on, especially
if it is not your project, just something you have checked out.  There
are two commands for this in Eldev.

First is `dependencies` (can be shortened to `deps`).  It lists
_direct_ dependencies of the project being built.  By default, it
omits any built-in packages, most importantly `emacs`.  If you want to
check those too, add option `-b` (`--list-built-ins`).

Second is `dependecy-tree` (short alias: `dtree`).  It prints a tree
of project direct dependencies, direct dependencies of those, and so
on — recursively.  Like with the first command, use option `-b` if you
want to see built-ins in the tree.

Both commands can also list additional dependencies if instructed:
just specify set name(s) on the command line, e.g.:

    $ eldev dependencies test

You can also check which archives Eldev uses to look up dependencies
for this particular project with the following command:

    $ eldev archives

=== Upgrading dependencies

Eldev will install project dependencies automatically, but it will
never upgrade them, at least if you don’t change your project to
require a newer version.  However, you can always explicitly ask Eldev
to upgrade the installed dependencies:

    $ eldev upgrade

First, package archive contents will be refetched, so that Eldev knows
about newly available versions.  Next, this command upgrades (or
installs, if necessary) all project dependencies and all additional
dependencies you might have registered (see
<<additional-dependencies,above>>).  If you don’t want to upgrade
everything, you can explicitly list names of the packages that should
be upgraded:

    $ eldev upgrade dash ht

You can also check what Eldev would upgrade without actually upgrading
anything:

    $ eldev upgrade --dry-run

{since-0-5} If you use MELPA for looking up dependencies, you can
switch between Stable and Unstable using global options with the same
name, i.e.:

    $ eldev --unstable upgrade

Because of the incompatible version numbers that MELPA Unstable
supplies, you cannot directly “upgrade” from an unstable version back
to a stable one.  But you can specify option `-d` (`--downgrade`) to
the command:

    $ eldev --stable upgrade -d

In this case Eldev will downgrade dependencies if this allows it to
use more preferable package archive.  (Since `--stable` is the
default, specifying it in the command above is not really needed, it’s
only mentioned for clarity.)

To install unstable version of only a specific dependency, while
leaving all others at stable versions, combine `--unstable` with
listing package names after the command, e.g.:

    $ eldev --unstable upgrade dash

==== Upgrading development tools

{since-0-6} Command `upgrade` works not only with package
dependencies, but also with common development tools used by the
project during development, for example <<buttercup,Buttercup>> or
<<linting,various linters>>.  This works exactly the same as for
project dependencies, with the only exception that the tool must be
installed first.  E.g., for Buttercup you need to <<testing,test>>
your project at least once, so that Eldev knows about the need for
this tool.

Development tools are installed from package archives hardcoded inside
Eldev (but see <<development-tool-sources,the next section>>),
regardless of which archives you have configured for your project.
For example, even if you use `melpa-unstable` archive, Buttercup will
still be installed from MELPA Stable (unless, of course, you use
`--unstable` global option).  If you need, you can switch to unstable
version of the tool later:

    $ eldev --unstable upgrade buttercup

[#development-tool-sources]
=== Development tool sources

Eldev knows how to install certain development tools and also uses
predefined package archives for this, not the ones you specify in
project’s configuration.  This means you don’t need to list archives
for tools like <<buttercup,Buttercup>>: only list them if they are
needed to look up real dependencies.

{since-0-9} There is a simple way to customize where exactly Eldev
finds the tools: use variable `eldev-known-tool-packages` for this.
The value of the variable is an alist keyed by tool names and
containing <<extended-dependency-format,package descriptor plists>> as
values.  By default it already contains information about the tools
Eldev knows about.  You can add more or replace existing ones if you
need: just `push` more entries at the beginning of the list, there is
no need to actually remove anything.

You can also use the tools as e.g. runtime dependencies if needed
(though in most cases you should leave this to Eldev).  Just specify
package plist as `(:tool TOOL-NAME)` for this.  Both tools with
built-in support and any new you add to `eldev-known-tool-packages`
can be referred this way.

Current list of the known tools:

* `buttercup`
* `package-lint`
* `relint`
* `elisp-lint`
* `undercover`

[#global-cache]
=== Global package archive cache

{since-0-4} To avoid downloading the same packages repeatedly, Eldev
employs a package archive cache.  This cache is shared between all
projects and <<different-emacs-versions,all Emacs versions>> on your
machine.  It can significantly speed up package preparation if you use
a new project, test it on another Emacs version or delete
project-specific cache (subdirectory `.eldev`) for whatever reason.

By default, downloaded packages stay cached indefinitely, while
archive contents expires in one hour.  However, if you use command
`upgrade` or `upgrade-self`, package archive contents is always
refreshed.

Cache usage is not controllable from command line.  However, you can
customize it somewhat in `~/.eldev/config`.  Variable
`eldev-enable-global-package-archive-cache` lets you disable the
global cache outright.  Using
`eldev-global-cache-archive-contents-max-age` you can adjust how long
cached copies of `archive-contents` stay valid.


[#loading-modes]
== Loading modes

In Eldev the project’s package and its local dependencies have
_loading modes_.  This affects exactly how the package (that of the
project or of its local dependency) becomes loadable by Emacs.

Default loading mode is called `as-is`.  It means the directory where
project (or local dependency) is located is simply added to Emacs
varible `load-path` and normal Emacs loading should be able to find
required features from there on.  This is the fastest mode, since it
requires no preparation and in most cases is basically what you want
during development.

However, users won’t have your project loaded like that.  To emulate
the way that most of the people will use it, you can use loading mode
`packaged`.  In this mode, Eldev will first build a package out of
your project (or local dependency), then install and activate it using
Emacs’ packaging system.  This is quite a bit slower than `as-is`,
because it involves several preparation steps.  However, this is
almost exactly the way normal users will use your project after
e.g. installing it from MELPA.  For this reason, this mode is
recommended for <<continuous-integration,continuous integration>> and
other forms of automated testing.

Other modes include `byte-compiled` and `source`.  In these modes
loading is performed just as in `as-is` mode, but before that Eldev
either byte-compiles everything or, vice-versa, removes `.elc` files.

So, after discussing the loading modes, let’s have a look at how
exactly you tell Eldev which one to use.

For the project itself, this is done from the command line using
global option `--loading` (or `-m`) with its argument being the name
of the mode.  Since this is supposed to be used quite frequently,
there are also shortcut options to select specific modes: `--as-is`
(or `-a`), `--packaged` (`-p`), `--source` (`-s`) or `--byte-compiled`
(`-c`).  For example, the following command will run unit-tests in the
project, having it loaded as an Emacs package:

    $ eldev -p test

Remember, that as everything in Eldev, this can be customized.
E.g. if you want to run your project byte-compiled by default, add
this to your `Eldev-local`:

[source]
----
(setf eldev-project-loading-mode 'byte-compiled)
----

For local dependencies the mode can be chosen when calling
`eldev-use-local-dependency`.  For example:

[source]
----
(eldev-use-local-dependency "~/barlib" 'packaged)
----

As mentioned above, loading mode defaults to `as-is`.

There are a few other loading modes useful only for certain projects.
You can always ask Eldev for a full list:

    $ eldev --list-modes

=== Autoloads

{since-0-6} Autoloaded functions of installed Elisp packages can be
accessed without a `require` form.  To simplify development, Eldev
provides the same functionality for projects regardless of loading
mode, as long as file `PACKAGE-autoloads.el` exists.  This might look
like an unwieldy requirement, but luckily there is
<<autoloads-plugin,a plugin>> for building the file and keeping it
up-to-date as necessary.  The reason this is not enabled by default is
that many projects — especially those not providing user-visible
functionality, or those that consist of a single file — don’t have any
autoloading functions or other forms.

Local dependencies also have their autoloads activated regardless of
loading mode.  If the autoloads file is kept up-to-date using
<<autoloads-plugin,the plugin>>, Eldev will take care to do this as
needed in local dependencies too.


== Build system

Eldev comes with quite a sofisticated build system.  While by default
it only knows how to build packages, byte-compile `.el` files and make
`.info` from `.texi`, you can extend it with custom _builders_ that
can do anything you want.  For example, generate resource files that
should be included in the final package.

The main command is predictably called `build`.  There are also
several related commands which will be discussed in the next sections.

=== Targets

Build system is based on _targets_.  Targets come in two kinds: _real_
and _virtual_.  First type of targets corresponds to files — not
necessarily already existing.  When needed, such targets get rebuilt
and the files are (re)generated in process.  Targets of the second
type always have names that begin with “:” (like keywords in Elisp).
Most import virtual target is called `:default` — this is what Eldev
will build if you don’t request anything explicitly.

To find all targets in a project (more precisely, its `main`
<<target-sets,target set>>):

    $ eldev targets

Project’s targets form a tree.  Before a higher-level target can be
built, all its children must be up-to-date, i.e. built first if
necessary.  In the tree you can also see _sources_ for some targets.
Those can be distinguished by lack of builder name in brackets.
Additionally, if output is colored, targets have special color, while
sources use default text color.

Here is how target tree looks for Eldev project itself (version may be
different and more targets may be added in future):

    :default
        bin/eldev  [SUBST]
            bin/eldev.in
    :package
        dist/eldev-0.1.tar  [PACK]
            bin/eldev  [repeated, see above]
            eldev-ert.el
            eldev-util.el
            eldev.el
    :compile
        eldev-ert.elc  [ELC]
            eldev-ert.el
        eldev-util.elc  [ELC]
            eldev-util.el
        eldev.elc  [ELC]
            eldev.el
    :package-archive-entry
        dist/eldev-0.1.entry  [repeated, see ‘dist/eldev-0.1.tar’ above]

And a short explanation of various elements:

`:default`, `:package`, `:compile` etc.::

    Virtual targets.  The ones you see above are typical, but there
    could be more.

`bin/eldev`, `dist/eldev-0.1.tar`, `eldev-ert.elc` etc.::

    Real targets.

`SUBST`, `PACK`, `ELC`::

    Builders used to generate target.  Note that virtual targets never
    have builders.  `SUBST` is not a standard builder, it is defined
    in file `Eldev` of the project.

`bin/eldev.in`, `eldev-ert.el` etc.::

    Sources for generating targets.  Certain targets have more than
    one source file.  Also note how targets can have other targets as
    their sources (`bin/eldev` is both a target on its own and a
    source for `dist/eldev-0.1.tar`).

`[repeated \...]`::

    To avoid exponential increase in tree size, Eldev doesn’t repeat
    target subtrees.  Instead, only root target of a subtree is
    printed.

==== Target cross-dependencies

FIXME

[#target-sets]
==== Target sets

Eldev groups all targets into _sets_.  Normally, there are only two
sets called `main` and `test`, but you can define more if you need
(see variable `eldev-filesets`).  For example, if your project
includes a development tool that certainly shouldn’t be included in
project’s package, it makes sense to break it out into a separate
target set.

Target sets should be seen only as ways of grouping targets together
for the purpose of quickly enumerating them.  Two targets in the same
set can be completely independent from each other.  Similarly, targets
from different sets can depend on each other (provided this doesn’t
create a circular dependency, of course).  For example, targets in set
`test` will often depend on those in set `main`, because test `.el`
files usually `require` some features from `main`.

By default, command `build` operates only on `main` target set.  You
can use option `--set` (`-s`) to process a different target set.  If
you want to build several sets at once, repeat the option as many
times as needed.  Finally, you can use special name `all` to order
Eldev to operate on all defined sets at once.

Command `targets` instead of the option expects set names as its
arguments.  For example:

    $ eldev targets test

[#packaging]
=== Building packages

To build an Elisp package out of your project, use command `package`:

    $ eldev package

This command is basically a wrapper over the build system, it tells
the system to generate virtual target `:package`.  However, there are
a few options that can only be passed to this special command, not to
underlying `build`.

Normally, packages are generated in subdirectory `dist` (more
precisely, in directory specified by `eldev-dist-dir` variable).  If
needed, you can override this using `--output-dir` option.

By default, Eldev will use package’s self-reported version, i.e. value
of “Version” header in its main `.el` file.  If you need to give the
package a different version, use option `--force-version`.  E.g. MELPA
would do this if it used Eldev.

Finally, if you are invoking Eldev from a different tool, you might be
interested in option `--print-filename`.  When it is specified, Eldev
will print absolute filename of the generated package and word
“generated” or “up-to-date” as the two last lines of its (stdout)
output.  Otherwise it is a bit tricky to find the package, especially
if you don’t use `--force-version` option.  As an optimisation, you
can also reuse previous package file if Eldev says “up-to-date”.

=== Byte-compiling

You can use Eldev to byte-compile your project.  Indirectly, this can
be done by <<loading-modes,selecting appropriate loading mode>> for
the project or its local dependencies.  However, sometimes you might
want to do this explicitly.  For this, use command `compile`:

    $ eldev compile

You can also byte-compile specific files:

    $ eldev compile foo-util.el foo-misc.el

Eldev will not recompile `.el` that have up-to-date `.elc` versions.
So, if you issue command `compile` twice in a row, it will say:
“Nothing to do” the second time.

However, simple comparison of modification time of `.el` and its
`.elc` file is not always enough.  Suppose file `foo-misc.el` has form
`(require 'foo-util)`.  If you edit `foo-util.el`, byte-compiled file
`foo-misc.elc` might no longer be correct, because it has been
compiled against old definitions from `foo-util.el`.  Luckily, Eldev
knows how to detect when a file ``require``s another.  You can see
this in the target tree:

    $ eldev targets --dependencies
    [...]
    :compile
        foo-misc.elc  [ELC]
            foo-misc.el
            [inh] foo-util.elc
    [...]

As a result, if you now edit `foo-util.el` and issue `compile` again,
both `foo-util.elc` and `foo-misc.elc` will be rebuilt.

Eldev treats warnings from Emacs’ byte-compiler just as that —
warnings, i.e. they will be shown, but will not prevent compilation
from generally succeeding.  However, during
<<continuous-integration,automated testing>> you might want to check
that there are no warnings.  The easiest way to do it is to use
`--warnings-as-errors` option (`-W`):

    $ eldev compile --warnings-as-errors

Command `compile` is actually only a wrapper over the generic building
system.  You can rewrite all the examples above using command `build`.
If you don’t specify files to compile, virtual target `:compile` is
built.  This target depends on all `.elc` files in the project.

However, there is a subtle difference: for `compile` you specify
_source_ files, while `build` expects _targets_.  Therefore, example

    $ eldev compile foo-util.el foo-misc.el

above is equivalent to this command:

    $ eldev build foo-util.elc foo-misc.elc

with `.el` in filenames substituted with `.elc`.

==== Byte-compiling complicated macros ====

Certain files with macros in Elisp cannot be byte-compiled without
evaluating them first _or_ carefully applying `eval-and-compile` to
functions used in macroexpansions.  Because Emacs packaging system
always loads (evaluates) package files before byte-compiling them
during installation, this is often overlooked.

Unlike the packaging system, Eldev by default expects that `.el` files
can be compiled _without_ loading them first, i.e. it expects that
`eval-and-compile` is applied where needed.  This is the default
because it is much faster on certain files.

However, if your project cannot be byte-compiled without loading first
and you don’t want to “fix” this, you can ask Eldev to behave like the
packaging system using `--load-before-compiling` (`-l`) option:

    $ eldev compile -l

Projects that can only be compiled with this setting should specify it
as the default in their file `Eldev`:

[source]
----
(setf eldev-build-load-before-byte-compiling t)
----

You can find more information in section
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Eval-During-Compile.html[“Evaluation
During Compilation” of Elisp manual].

==== Speed of byte-compilation ====

While not particularly important in most cases, speed of
byte-compilation can become an issue in large projects, especially if
they use lots of macros.  Eldev tries to speed up byte-compilation by
compiling the files in “correct” order.

This means that if, as above, `foo-misc.el` ``require``s feature
`foo-util`, then `foo-util.el` will always be byte-compiled first, so
that compilation of `foo-misc.el` can use faster, byte-compiled
versions of definitions from that file.  This works even if Eldev
doesn’t yet know which files `require` which.

When Eldev has to change the planned order of byte-compilation because
of a `require` form, it writes an appropriate message (you need to run
with option `-v` or `-t` to see it):

    $ eldev -v compile
    [...]
    ELC      foo-misc.el
    Byte-compiling file ‘foo-misc.el’...
    ELC      foo-util.el
    Byte-compiling file ‘foo-util.el’ early as ‘require’d from another file...
    Done building “sources” for virtual target ‘:compile’

[#cleaning]
=== Cleaning

While cleaning is not really part of the build system, it is closely
related.  Cleaning allows you to remove various generated files that
are the result of other commands (not only `build`).  Command can be
executed without any arguments:

    $ eldev clean

In this case, it removes byte-compiled Elisp files and any `.info`
files generated from `.texi`/`.texinfo` if you have those in your
project.

In general case, you can specify name one or more _cleaners_ as
command arguments.  All supported cleaners can be found using option
`--list-cleaners` (`-L`).  Here is a short list of some of the more
useful ones:

`.eldev`::

    Delete Eldev’s cache, i.e. subdirectory `.eldev` for this project.

`distribution` (or `dist`)::

    Delete `dist` subdirectory; useful after <<packaging,building
    project’s package>>.

`test-results` (or `tests`)::

    Forget <<test-results,previous test results>>, for ERT.

`global-cache`::

    Remove contents of the <<global-cache,global package archive
    cache>>.  This can be executed from any directory.

`all` (or `everything`)::

    Run all available cleaners.  Some cross-project data may still be
    retained (currently, only the global package archive cache), that
    can be cleaned only by explicitly mentioning it.

Cleaners executed by default are called `.elc`, `.info` and
`info-dir`.  Normally, they delete their targets in all
<<target-sets,target sets>> at once.  However, you can limit them to
`main`, `test` and so on set with option `-s` (`--set`), e.g. command:

    $ eldev clean -s test

would delete all byte-compiled test files.

You can also specify option `-n` (`--dry-run`) to see what would be
deleted, without actually deleting it.


[#testing]
== Testing

Eldev has built-in support for running regression/unit tests of your
project.  Currently, Eldev supports only {uri-ert}[ERT] and
{uri-buttercup}[Buttercup] testing frameworks.  Leave a feature
request in the issue tracker if you are interested in a different
library.

Simply executing

    $ eldev test

will run all your tests.  By default, all tests are expected to be in
files named `test.el`, `tests.el`, `+*-test.el+`, `+*-tests.el+` or in
`test` or `tests` subdirectories of the project root.  But you can
always change the value of `eldev-test-fileset` variable in the
project’s `Eldev` as appropriate.

By default, the command runs all available tests.  However, during
development you often need to run one or a few tests only — when you
hunt a specific bug, for example.  Eldev provides two ways to select
which tests to run.

First is by using a _selector_ (<<frameworks,framework-specific>>,
this example is for <<ert,ERT>>):

    $ eldev test foo-test-15

will run only the test with that specific name.  It is of course
possible to select more than one test by specifying multiple
selectors: they are combined with ‘or’ operation.  You can use any
selector supported by the testing framework here, see its
documentation.

The second way is to avoid loading (and executing) certain test files
altogether.  This can be achieved with `--file` (`-f`) option:

    $ eldev test -f foo.el

will execute tests only in file `foo.el` and not in e.g. `bar.el`.
You don’t need to specify directory (e.g. `test/foo.el`); for reasons
why, see <<filesets,explanation of Eldev filesets below>>.

Both ways of selecting tests can be used together.  In this case they
are combined with ‘and’ operation: only tests that match selector and
which are defined in a loaded file are run.

When a test is failing, a backtrace of the failure is printed.  You
can affect its readability and completeness using options `-b`
(`--print-backtrace`, the default) and `-B` (`--omit-backtraces`).
The first option accepts your screen width as an optional parameter;
backtrace lines get cut to the specified width.  (Since 0.7 this can
also be specified as a global option that additionally affects all
other backtraces that are printed by Eldev.)  Special value of 0 (the
default in Eldev) disables truncation of backtrace lines.  Second
option, `-B`, is surprisingly useful.  In many cases backtraces don’t
actually give any useful information, especially when the tests
contain only a single assertion, and only clutter the output.  If you
have different preferences compared to Eldev, you can customize
variable `eldev-test-print-backtraces` in file `~/.eldev/config`.

How exactly tests are executed depends on _test runner_.  If you
dislike the default behavior of Eldev, you can choose a different test
runner using `--runner` (`-r`) option of `test` command; see the list
of available test runners with their descriptions using
`--list-runners` option.  If you always use a different test runner,
it is a good idea to set it as the default in file `~/.eldev/config`.
Finally, you can even write your own runner.

[#frameworks]
=== Frameworks

As stated above, Eldev supports {uri-ert}[ERT] (Emacs built-in) and
{uri-buttercup}[Buttercup] testing frameworks.  Normally, you don’t
need to specify which framework the project uses, as the tool can
autodetect that.  But in rare cases you may need to set variable
`eldev-test-framework` to either `'ert` or `'buttercup`, as
appropriate.  You also don’t need to declare testing package as
<<additional-dependencies,an extra dependency>>: Eldev will install it
itself when needed.

Eldev tries to provide uniform command line interface to the supported
frameworks, but of course there are many differences between them.

[#ert]
==== ERT

{uri-ert}[ERT] is the “default” testing framework and also an Emacs
built-in.  This means that no additional packages need to be installed
and the framework is available on all non-ancient Emacs versions (at
least all Eldev itself supports).

All functionality of `test` command works with ERT.

[#buttercup]
==== Buttercup

{since-0-2} {uri-buttercup}[Buttercup] is a behavior-driven
development framework for testing Emacs Lisp code.  Its support in
Eldev has some limitations.  On the other hand, certain functionality
is not supported by the library itself, and e.g. its `bin/buttercup`
script also doesn’t provide similar features.

When using Buttercup, selectors are _patterns_ from
{uri-buttercup-rt}[the library’s documentation].  I.e. they are
regular expressions in Emacs syntax, and only tests with names
matching at least one of the specified selectors/patterns are
executed.

Things that won’t work with Buttercup at the moment:

* option `--stop-on-unexpected` (`-s`);
* specifying screen width with option `--print-backtraces` (`-b`): it
  will always work as if 80 was specified.

Unlike <<ert,ERT>>, Buttercup also has no special selectors that base
on the previous run’s results.

=== Loading test files

{since-0-5} There appears to be two common ways of using tests: 1)
they are loaded from project root; 2) subdirectory `test/` (or
similar) in the project is added to `load-path`.  Eldev supports both.
First one is the default, since it doesn’t require anything in
addition.

To better understand the second way, imagine your project structure is
like this:

....
    tests/
        test-helper.el
        test-my-project.el
....

and file `test-my-project.el` includes a form `(require
'test-helper)`.  Naturally, this setup will work only if subdirectory
`tests/` is in `load-path` by the point tests are executed.  To
instruct Eldev that your project needs this, add the following to file
`Eldev`:

[source]
----
(eldev-add-loading-roots 'test "tests")
----

where `'test` is the command name and `"tests"` is the name of the
subdirectory that should serve as additional loading root.  In
principle, loading roots can also be used for other commands too, just
like <<additional-dependencies,extra dependencies>>.

If you want to switch to the first way and avoid special forms in file
`Eldev`, replace `(require 'test-helper)` with `(require
'tests/test-helper)`.

[#test-results]
=== Reusing previous test results

<<ert,ERT>> provides a few selectors that operate on tests’ last
results.  Even though different Eldev executions will run in different
Emacs processes, you can still use these selectors: Eldev stores and
then loads last results of test execution as needed.

For example, execute all tests until some fails (`-s` is a shortcut
for `--stop-on-unexpected`):

    $ eldev test -s

If any fails, you might want to fix it and rerun again, to see if the
fix helped.  The easiest way is:

    $ eldev test :failed

For more information, see {uri-ert-sel}[documentation on ERT
selectors] — other “special” selectors (e.g. `:new` or `:unexpected`)
also work.

[#testing-simplifications]
=== Testing command line simplifications

When variable `eldev-dwim` (“do what I mean”) is non-nil (as by
default), Eldev supports a few simplifications of the command line to
make testing even more streamlined.

* For all frameworks: any selector that ends in `.el` is instead
  treated as a file pattern.  For example:
+
--
    $ eldev test foo.el

will work as if you specified `-f` before `foo.el`.
--

* For <<ert,ERT>>: any symbol selector that doesn’t match a test name
  is instead treated as regular expression (i.e. as a string).  For
  example:
+
--
    $ eldev test foo

will run all tests with names that contain `foo`.  You can achieve the
same result with ‘strict’ command line (see also ERT selector
documentation) like this:

    $ eldev test \"foo\"
--

If you dislike these simplifications, set `eldev-dwim` to `nil` in
`~/.eldev/config`.


[#linting]
== Linting

{since-0-2} It might be useful to ensure that your source code follows
certain standards.  There are many programs called linters that can
help you with this.  Several of them are also supported by Eldev and
can be executed using the tool.

In its simplest form `lint` command will execute all supported linters
and let them loose on your source code in `main` target set:

    $ eldev lint

You don’t need to install anything additionally: Eldev will download
and use required packages itself.  Because of this, first linting in a
project might take a while to prepare, but later the downloaded
linters will be reused.

Currently, Eldev knows and uses the following linters:

* Emacs built-in `checkdoc`.  Verifies documentation strings of your
  functions, variables and so on for various style errors.
* {uri-package-lint}[`package-lint`], which detects erroneous package
  metadata, missing dependencies and much more.
* {uri-relint}[`relint`] that can detects errors in regular expression
  strings in your source code.
* {since-0-6} {uri-elisp-lint}[`elisp-lint`] that checks Elisp code
  for various errors — it is even more versatile than `package-lint`
  and actually optionally includes it.

In future, more linters can gain special treatmeant from Eldev (you
can also leave a feature request in the issue tracker).  The full list
can always be found using command `eldev lint --list`.

Running all the linters at once is not always what you want.  In such
a case you can just specify name (or several) of the linter you want
on the command line:

    $ eldev lint doc

Names can be simplified by dropping words “check” and “lint” from
them.  It is also possible to explicitly direct linters at certain
files, rather than verifying all at once:

    $ eldev lint re -f foo.el

Like with <<testing-simplifications,testing>>, you can omit `-f`
(`--file`) option above as long as variable `eldev-dwim` is non-nil.

Some projects, however, may decide to follow advices of certain
linters, but not the others.  You can explicitly tell Eldev about
project’s policy by adjusting one or more of variables
`eldev-lint-default`, `eldev-lint-default-excluded` and
`eldev-lint-disabled` in file `Eldev`.  All of these variables affect
which linters exactly Eldev starts when their names are not specified
explicitly.

Command `lint` sets Eldev’s exit status to non-zero if there is at
least one warning from any requested linter.  This simplifies using
linting in <<continuous-integration,continuous integration>> should
you want to do that.


== Quickly evaluating expressions

It is often useful to evaluate Elisp expressions in context of the
project you develop — and probably using functions from the project.
There are two commands for this in Eldev: `eval` and `exec`.  The only
difference between them is that `exec` doesn’t print results to
stdout, i.e. it assumes that the forms you evaluate produce some
detectable side-effects.  Because of this similarity, we’ll consider
only `eval` here.

The basic usage should be obvious:

    $ eldev eval "(+ 1 2)"

Of course, evaluating `(+ 1 2)` form is not terribly useful.  Usually
you’ll want to use at least one function or variable from the project.
However, for that you need your project not only to be in `load-path`
(which Eldev guarantees), but also ``require``d.  Luckily, you don’t
have to repeat `(require 'my-package)` all the time on the command
line, as Eldev does this too, so normally you can just run it like
this:

    $ eldev eval "(my-package-function)"

What Eldev actually does is requiring all features listed in variable
`eldev-eval-required-features`.  If value of that variable is symbol
`:default`, value of `eldev-default-required-features` is taken
instead.  And finally, when value of the latter is symbol
`:project-name`, only one feature with the same name as that of the
project is required.  In 95% of the cases this is exactly what you
need.  However, if the main feature of the project has a different
name, you can always change the value of one of the mentioned
variables in file `Eldev`.

It can also make sense to change the variable’s value in `Eldev-local`
if you want certain features to always be available for quick testing.


== Running Emacs

Sometimes you want to run Emacs with _just_ your project installed and
see how it works without any customization.  You can achieve this in
Eldev easily:

    $ eldev emacs

This will spawn a separate Emacs that doesn’t read any initialization
scripts and doesn’t have access to your usual set of installed
packages, but instead has access to the project being built with Eldev
— and its dependencies, of course.  Similar as with `eval` and `exec`
commands, features listed in variable `eldev-emacs-required-features`
are required automatically.

You can also pass any Emacs options through the command line.  For
example, this will visit file `foo.bar`, which is useful if your
project is a mode for `.bar` files:

    $ eldev emacs foo.bar

See `emacs --help` for what you can specify on the command line.

When issued as shown above, command `emacs` will pass the rest of the
command line to Emacs, but also add a few things on its own.  First,
it adds everything from the list `eldev-emacs-default-command-line`,
which disables `~/.emacs` loading and similar things.  Second, it
transfers variables listed in `eldev-emacs-forward-variables` to the
child process (this is done in order to keep
<<project-isolation,project isolation>> promises).  Third, adds
`--eval` arguments to require the features as described above.  And
only after that comes the actual command line you specified.

Occasionally you might not want this behavior.  In this case, prepend
`--` to the command line — then Eldev will pass everything after it to
the spawned Emacs as-is (with the exception of still transferring
variables listed in `eldev-emacs-forward-variables`).  Remember that
you will likely need to pass at least `-q` (`--no-init-file`) option
to Emacs, otherwise it will probably fail on your `~/.emacs` since it
will not see your usual packages.  To illustrate:

    $ eldev emacs -- -q foo.bar


[#different-emacs-versions]
== Executing on different Emacs versions

Since Eldev itself is an Elisp program, version of Emacs you use can
affect any aspect of execution — even before it gets to running
something out of your project.  Therefore, inside its “cache”
directory called `.eldev`, the utility creates a subdirectory named
after Emacs version it is executed on.  If it is run with a different
Emacs, it will not use dependencies or previous test results, but
rather install or recompute them from scratch.

Normally, Eldev uses command `emacs` that is supposed to be resolvable
through `$PATH` environment variable.  However, you can always tell it
to use a different Emacs version by setting either `ELDEV_EMACS` or
just `EMACS` in the environment, e.g.:

    $ EMACS=emacs25 eldev eval emacs-version

This is especially useful for testing your project with different
Emacs versions.

Remember, however, that Eldev cannot separate byte-compiled files
(`.elc`) from sources.  From documentation of
`byte-compile-dest-file-function`:

____
Note that the assumption that the source and compiled files are found
in the same directory is hard-coded in various places in Emacs.
____

Therefore, if you use byte-compilation and switch Emacs versions,
don’t forget to clean the directory.


[#continuous-integration]
== Continuous integration

Because of Eldev’s trivial installation and built-in support for
testing, it is a suitable tool for use on continuous integration
servers.  But of course this only applies if the test framework your
project uses is already supported (currently <<ert,ERT>> and
<<buttercup,Buttercup>>).

[#github-workflows]
=== GitHub workflows

The easiest option for continuous integration for GitHub-hosted
projects are {uri-github-wflows}[GitHub workflows], as this doesn’t
involve using a 3rd-party service.  Probably most of Elisp projects
can take advantage of this, since GitHub appears to be the most
popular hosting for Elisp projects.

Workflow definition files for GitHub are somewhat more verbose than
for <<travis-ci,Travis CI>>, but ultimately not really more
complicated.  The easiest way to install Emacs binary of appropriate
version is to use {uri-setup-emacs}[`purcell/setup-emacs`] action
(which internally uses {uri-nix-emacs}[nix-emacs-ci]).  Since
{uri-evm}[EVM] seems tuned to Ubuntu Trusty (i.e. what Travis CI
provides), it is likely unsuitable for GitHub workflows.

There is a short shell script that installs Eldev itself for use on
GitHub runners.  Modifying `$PATH` there is a bit tricky, so you
probably should just go with the script, as demonstrated below.

A basic workflow file (you can e.g. name it
`.github/workflows/test.yml`) would look something like this:

....
name: CI

on:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        emacs_version:
          # Add more lines like this if you want to test on different Emacs versions.
          - 26.3

    steps:
    - name: Set up Emacs
      uses: purcell/setup-emacs@master
      with:
        version: ${{matrix.emacs_version}}

    - name: Install Eldev
      run: curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/webinstall/github-eldev | sh

    - name: Check out the source code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Test the project
      run: |
        eldev -p -dtT test
....

Eldev’s terminal autorecognition doesn’t work on GitHub machines
(unlike e.g. on Travis CI).  If you want colored output from Eldev,
you need to explicitly enable it using `-C` (`--color`) global option.

[#travis-ci]
=== Travis CI

{uri-travis}[Travis CI] is perhaps the most used continuous
integration service for Elisp code, at least until the addition of
<<github-workflows,GitHub workflows>>.  The largest problem on Travis
CI is to install Emacs binary of the desired version.  Luckily, there
are tools that can be used for this: at least {uri-evm}[EVM] and
{uri-nix-emacs}[nix-emacs-ci].

==== EVM

One of the tools to install Emacs is {uri-evm}[EVM].  Steve Purcell
(the author of `nix-emacs-ci`) mentions “various issues” he has had
with it, however many projects use it.  Apparently, you need to fix
Ubuntu distribution used at Travis CI to Trusty for EVM-provided
binaries.  Also note that EVM provides binaries only for Linux, so if
you want test on macOS too, `nix-emacs-ci` is a better choice.

If you also want to try it, Eldev provides a simple script
specifically for use on Travis CI that installs Eldev and EVM in one
go.  Here is a simple project-agnostic `.travis.yml` file that you can
use as a basis:

....
language: emacs-lisp
dist: trusty

env:
  # Add more lines like this if you want to test on different Emacs versions.
  - EVM_EMACS=emacs-26.3-travis

install:
  - curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/webinstall/travis-eldev-and-evm > x.sh && source ./x.sh
  - evm install $EVM_EMACS --use

script:
  - eldev -p -dtT test
....

==== nix-emacs-ci

A newer tool to install Emacs is {uri-nix-emacs}[nix-emacs-ci].  Using
it is easy: define environment variable `$EMACS_CI` with the desired
Emacs version and `curl` a single shell script — whether on Linux or
macOS.  With one more line you can also install Eldev.  It appears to
be slower than EVM, but for continuous integration that’s not terribly
important.

A basic `.travis.yml` would look like this:

....
language: nix

env:
  # Add more lines like this if you want to test on different Emacs versions.
  - EMACS_CI=emacs-26-3

install:
  - bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purcell/nix-emacs-ci/master/travis-install)
  - curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/webinstall/travis-eldev > x.sh && source ./x.sh

script:
  - eldev -p -dtT test
....

[#circle-ci]
=== CircleCI

Another frequently used service is {uri-circle}[CircleCI].  I don’t
know that much about it, presumably {uri-nix-emacs}[nix-emacs-ci] can
be used to install Emacs on it.  Some projects successfully use
{uri-docker}[Docker] images.

Regardless of how you install Emacs, adding Eldev is yet another
one-liner.  It is handy to use, because propagating `$PATH`
modifications between different commands on CircleCI is somewhat
non-obvious.  To use it, add the following lines in the relevant place
in file `.circleci/config.yml`:

....
    ...
    - run:
        name: Install Eldev
        command: curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/doublep/eldev/master/webinstall/circle-eldev > x.sh && source ./x.sh
....

=== Script commands

Once you have Emacs with Eldev set up on the continuous integration
server of your choice, it is time to actually test your project.  The
most basic command is, naturally, `eldev test`.  You might want to add
a few options to both make project loading more similar to that
typical for your users and Eldev’s output more informative:

    $ eldev -p -dtT test

To make sure that your project byte-compiles cleanly, use the
following command:

    $ eldev -dtT compile --warnings-as-errors

Or maybe even this, if you want to make sure that test `.el` files
also can be byte-compiled without warnings (this can sometimes catch
more problems):

    $ eldev -dtT compile --set all --warnings-as-errors

You can also enforce conformance to certain coding standards by adding
an invocation of `lint` to the `script` part.  Remember, however, that
most linters are continuously being developed.  Even if a linter finds
your source warning-free today, it might detect problems tomorrow.
`relint` is probably one of the “safer” linters in this regard:

    $ eldev -dtT lint re


[#debugging-features]
== Debugging features

Eldev comes with lots of different options and other features that can
help you debug problems both in your project, Eldev itself or your
Eldev scripts.

* Global options `-t` (`--trace`), `-v` (`--verbose`) and `-q`
  (`--quiet`) control the amount of output Eldev generates.  The first
  one makes Eldev extra verbose, helping you to understand what it is
  doing and at which step something goes wrong.

* Global option `-d` (`--debug`) makes Eldev print backtrace if it
  dies with a Elisp signal (except certain well-defined and explained
  errors like missing dependency).

* {since-0-3} Global option `-Q` (`--backtrace-on-abort`) makes Eldev
  print backtrace if it is aborted with `^C`.  This is useful if your
  project freezes or has very bad performance, and you want to figure
  out where exactly this happens.

* {since-0-8} Global option `-b` (`--backtrace`) lets you adapt
  backtraces to your screen width and thus make them more readable at
  the expense of completeness (by default, Eldev doesn’t truncate
  backtrace lines).  It is a good idea to change the default in file
  `.eldev/config`.

* Global option `-T` (`--time`) prepends timestamps to all lines of
  Eldev output, making it easier to spot performance problems.

* Command `prepare` can be used to install all project dependencies —
  and thus check if they and package archives are specified correctly
  — without doing anything else.

* Commands `deps` (`dependencies`) and `dtree` (`dependency-tree`) can
  be used to display list or tree of project dependencies, which is
  especially useful for large projects unfamiliar to you.

* For many errors, Eldev will print additional hints (unless you
  specify option `--quiet`).  For example: if an error happens during
  evaluating file `Eldev`, the tool will mention this; if a dependency
  cannot be installed, Eldev will mention what required this
  dependency (can be non-obvious in larger packages).

* While not a direct feature of Eldev itself, file `Eldev-local`
  provides a good place to install temporary advices, overwrite Emacs
  functions etc. in the process of debugging certain problems.

* You can temporarily add calls to `eldev-warn`, `eldev-backtrace` and
  other Eldev functions to the tests in your project to provide
  additional output.  But it is a good idea to do this only while
  debugging and avoid committing such changes.


== Plugins

{since-0-3} Plugins are activatable extensions to Eldev functionality.
They provide features that are not needed for most projects and
are therefore not enabled by default.  However, enabling a plugin is
trivial — just add line:

[source]
----
(eldev-use-plugin 'PLUGIN-NAME)
----

to file `Eldev` of your project.  For example:

[source]
----
(eldev-use-plugin 'autoloads)
----

As for other configuration, you can also do it in `Eldev-local` or
<<setup-procedure,other places>>.

In future, plugins may become externally-managed and “detached” from
Eldev itself (create an issue if you are interested).  For now,
however, Eldev provides two built-in plugins.

You can check if a project has any plugins activated — and
documentation for those plugins:

    $ eldev plugins

Run Eldev in quiet mode (`-q`) to get only the list, without the long
documentation:

    $ eldev -q plugins

Remember that if a project activates a plugin in a non-standard way,
for example from <<hooks,a hook>>, command `plugins` will not see it.

There is currently no way to list all available plugins.  However, as
of yet there are only two plugins anyway.

[#autoloads-plugin]
=== autoloads

{since-0-6} A plugin that enables automatic collection of functions
and other forms marked with `;;;###autoload` cookie in project’s `.el`
files.  It tries to behave exactly the same as for installed Elisp
packages, so that there are no differences between development and
installed versions of the project.

The plugin is not on by default because many projects don’t use
autoloading functionality at all and having file
`PACKAGE-autoloads.el` magically appear all the time in them would be
annoying.

To have autoloads automatically collected in your project, just
activate the plugin: add form `(eldev-use-plugin 'autoloads)` to the
project’s file `Eldev`.  You don’t need any additional steps to
instruct Eldev how to use the generated file.  In fact, it is able to
do this even without the plugin: the plugin only takes cares to build
and update the file as necessary.

If the plugin is activated, you can see new target `:autoloads` in the
output of `targets` command.  In addition to being built by default,
this file is also generated whenever Eldev needs to load the project:
for commands `test`, `eval`, `exec` and `emacs`.  Finally, the file is
also registered as a dependency to all `.elc` targets in the project;
this way, byte-compiling always has access to up-to-date list of
autoloaded functions.

This plugin can also be activated in projects you use as
<<local-dependencies,local dependencies>> for other projects.  Eldev
knows how to keep the autoloads file up-to-date in all local
dependencies, regardless of their loading mode.

[#undercover-plugin]
=== undercover

{since-0-3} This built-in plugin provides integration with
{uri-undercover}[undercover] tool that generates coverage reports for
your tests.  It is active only for <<testing,command `test`>>.  By
default, behavior of the tool is unaltered (with the exception that
reports are not merged), so effectively it will do nothing unless run
on a supported <<continuous-integration,continuous integration>>
server.

To have your project’s code coverage statistics automatically gathered
during continuous integration, all you need to do is:

. Activate the plugin: add `(eldev-use-plugin 'undercover)` to your
  project’s file `Eldev`.

. Make sure that command `test` is executed during automated testing
  (e.g. in file `.travis.yml`) in `as-is`, `source` or `built-source`
  <<loading-modes,loading mode>>.  If you want, you can run it
  again additionally in `packaged` mode.

The plugin adds two options for command `test`: `--undercover` (`-u`)
and `--undercover-report` (`-U`).  First option can be used to
configure the plugin and the tool, the second — to change report
filename.  Value for the option `-u` should be a comma and/or
space-separated list of any of the following flags:

`auto`, `on` (`always`), `off` (`never`)::

    whether to generate the report; default value is `auto`;

`coveralls`, `simplecov`, `codecov`, `text`::

    format of the report to generate; default is `coveralls`;

`merge`, `restart`::

    whether to merge with existing report; note that by default report
    is _restarted_, i.e. existing report file is deleted;

`send`, `dontsend`::

    whether to send the generated report to
    {uri-coveralls}[coveralls.io] (only for the suitable format);
    default is to send.

Additionally, when `eldev-dwim` is non-nil, certain flags can affect
each other:

* if report format is not set explicitly, it is derived from extension
  of report filename if possible: `.json` for `simplecov` format,
  `.txt` or `.text` for a text report; `codecov` format cannot be set
  this way, currently;
* when requested format is not `coveralls`, report is always generated
  unless `auto` or `off` (`never`) is specified explicitly.

Based on the above, easiest way to generate a local coverage report is
something like this:

    $ eldev test -U simplecov.json

Full help for the plugin can always be checked by running `eldev
plugins` in a project with the plugin activated.


[#filesets]
== Filesets

Filesets are lists of rules that determine a collection of files
inside given root directory, usually the project directory.  Similar
concepts are present in most build tools, version control systems and
some other programs.  Filesets in Eldev are inspired by Git.

Important examples of filesets are variables `eldev-main-fileset`,
`eldev-test-fileset` and `eldev-standard-excludes`.  Default values of
all three are _simple filesets_, but are not actually restricted to
those: when customizing for your project you can use any valid fileset
as a value for any of these variables.  However, for most cases simple
filesets are all that you really need.

=== Simple filesets

From Lisp point of view, a simple fileset is a list of strings.  A
single-string list can also be replaced with that string.  The most
important filesets are `eldev-main-fileset` and `eldev-test-fileset`.
Using them you can define which `.el` files are to be packaged and
which contain tests.  Default values should be good enough for most
projects, but you can always change them in file `Eldev` if needed.

Each rule is a string that matches file path — or its part — relative
to the root directory.  Path elements must be separated with a slash
(`/`) regardless of your OS, to be machine-independent.  A rule may
contain glob wildcards (`+*+` and `?`) with the usual meaning and also
double-star wildcard (`+**+`) that must be its own path element.  It
stands for any number (including zero) of nested subdirectories.
Example:

    foo/**/bar-*.el

matches `foo/bar-1.el` and `foo/x/y/bar-baz.el`.

If a rule starts with an exclamation mark (`!`), it is an _exclusion_
rule.  Files that match it (after the mark is stripped) are excluded
from the result.  Other (“normal”) rules are called _inclusion_ rules.

Typically, a rule must match any part of a file path (below the root,
of course).  However, if a rule starts with `/` or `./` it is called
_anchored_ and must match beginning of a file path.  For example, rule
`./README` matches file `README` in the root directory, but not in any
of its subdirectories.

If a rule matches a directory, it also matches all of the files the
directory contains (with arbitrary nesting level).  For example, rule
`test` also matches file `test/foo/bar.el`.

A rule that ends in a slash directly matches only directories.  But,
in accordance to the previous paragraph, also all files within such
directories.  So, there is a subtle difference: a rule `test/` won’t
match a file named `test`, but will match any file within a directory
named `test`.

Finally, note a difference with Git concerning inclusions/exclusions
and subdirectories.  Git manual says: _“It is not possible to
re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.”_
Eldev filesets have no such exceptions.

=== Composite filesets

Eldev also supports composite filesets.  They are built using common
set/logic operations and can be nested, i.e. one composite fileset can
include another.  There are currently three types:

`(:and ELEMENT\...)`::

  A file matches an `:and` fileset if and only if it matches _every_
  of its `ELEMENT` filesets.

`(:or ELEMENT\...)`::

  A file matches an `:or` fileset if and only if it matches _at least
  one_ of its `ELEMENT` filesets.

`(:not NEGATED)`::

  A file matches a `:not` fileset when it _doesn’t match_ its
  `NEGATED` fileset and vice versa.

=== Evaluated filesets

Finally, some parts of filesets — but not elements of simple filesets!
— can be evaluated.  An evaluated element can be a variable name (a
symbol) or a form.  When matching, such element will be evaluated
_once_, before `eldev-find-files` or `eldev-filter-files` start actual
work.

Result of evaluating such an expression can be an evaluated fileset in
turn — Eldev will keep evaluating elements until results finally
consist of only simple and composite filesets.  To prevent accidental
infinite loops, there is a limit of `eldev-fileset-max-iterations` on
how many times sequential evaluations can yield symbols or forms.

Example of an evaluated fileset can be seen from return value of
`eldev-standard-fileset` function.  E.g.:

[source]
----
(eldev-standard-fileset 'main)
=> (:and eldev-main-fileset (:not eldev-standard-excludes))
----

As the result contains references to two variables, they will be
evaluated in turn — and so on, until everything is resolved.


[#extending-eldev]
== Extending Eldev

Eldev is written to be not just configurable, but also extensible.  It
makes perfect sense to have additional code in file `Eldev` — if your
project has uncommon building steps.  And also in `~/.eldev/config` —
if you want a special command for your own needs, for example.  Or
maybe in `Eldev-local` — if you need something extra only for one
specific project that you maintain.

[#hooks]
=== Hooks

Eldev defines several hooks executed at different times (more might be
added later).

`eldev-executing-command-hook`::

    Run before executing any command.  Command name (as a symbol) is
    passed to the hook’s functions as the only argument.  This is
    always the “canonical” command name, even if it is run using an
    alias.

`eldev-COMMAND-hook`::

    Run before executing specific command, functions have no
    arguments.  Eldev itself uses it (i.e. in its file `Eldev`) to
    print a disclaimer about its fairly slow tests.

{since-0-2} `eldev-load-dependencies-hook`::

    Executed after successfully loading dependencies.  Functions are
    called with arguments `TYPE` and `ADDITIONAL-SETS`.  `TYPE` is
    either `t` if the project is being loaded for actual use, symbol
    `load-only` if it is loaded only for side effect (e.g. to build a
    tree of its dependencies), and `nil` if invoked from
    `eldev-load-extra-dependencies` (i.e. if the project is not being
    loaded at all: only some additional sets).  The second is a list
    of <<additional-dependencies,additional dependency sets>>.

{since-0-6} `eldev-before-loading-dependencies-hook`::

    Similar to the previous hook, but called _before_ dependencies are
    loaded.  Function arguments are the same.

{since-0-1-1} `eldev-build-system-hook`::

    Hook executed whenever build system is used.  This is useful since
    at least commands `build`, `compile` and `package` invoke the
    build system: it would be impractical to add the same function to
    all three hooks.

{since-0-2} `eldev-test-FRAMEWORK-hook`::

    Called immediately before executing tests with given framework
    (<<ert,ERT>> or <<buttercup,Buttercup>>).  Functions on the hook
    get passed `SELECTORS` as the only argument.  At this point
    project dependencies and additional set `test` will have been
    loaded already, so functions can `require` features from the
    project.

=== Writing builders

Eldev build system provides standard builders that cover all basic
needs of Elisp packages.  However, some projects have uncommon build
steps.  Instead of writing custom shell scripts, you can integrate
them into the overall build process — which also simplifies further
development.

An example of a project with additional build steps is Eldev itself.
Its executable(s) are combined from executable template that is
OS-specific and a common Elisp bootstrapping script.  For example,
`bin/eldev` is generated from files `bin/eldev.in` and
`bin/bootstrap.el.part`.  However, only the first file counts as the
source; see how function `eldev-substitute` works.

There is a simple builder for this in file `Eldev` of the project:

[source]
----
(eldev-defbuilder eldev-builder-preprocess-.in (source target)
  :short-name     "SUBST"
  :message        source-and-target
  :source-files   "*.in"
  :targets        (".in" -> "")
  :collect        ":default"
  :define-cleaner (eldev-cleaner-preprocessed
                   "Delete results of preprocessing `.in' files.  This is specific
to Eldev itself."
                   :aliases prep)
  (let ((modes (file-modes target)))
    (eldev-substitute source target)
    (when (or modes (string-prefix-p "bin/" target))
      (set-file-modes target (or modes #o755)))))
----

Here `eldev-defbuilder` is a macro much like `defun`.  It defines an
Elisp function named `eldev-builder-preprocess-.in` and registers it
with parameters (the keyword lines before the body) as an Eldev
builder.  Predictably, list `(source target)` specifies function
arguments.

Let’s skip the keywords for a bit and have a look at the body.  It
works exactly like in a normal Elisp function.  Its job is to generate
`target` from `source` using builder-specific means.  This particular
builder calls function `eldev-substite` that does the actual work
(this function is available also to your project, should you need it).
But your builders could do whatever you want, including launching
external processes (C/C++ compiler, a Python script, etc.) and using
anything from Elisp repertoire.  Note that return value of the body is
ignored.  If building the target fails, builder should signal an
error.

Now back to the keyword parameters.  As you can see, they all have a
name and exactly one value after it.  First comes parameter
`:short-name`.  It specifies what you see in the target tree of the
project, i.e. builder’s name for the user.  It is not required;
without it Eldev would have used `preprocess-.in` as user-visible
name.

Next parameter is `:message`.  It determines what Eldev prints when
the builder is actually invoked.  For example, when byte-compiling,
you’d see messages like this:

    ELC      some-file.el

That’s because byte-compiling builder has its `:message` set to
`source` (the default).  Other valid values are `target` and
`source-and-target` (as in the example).  Both `source` and `target`
can be pluralized (i.e. `sources-and-target` is also a valid value),
but singular/plural is not important in this case as both work
identically.  Finally, value of `:message` can be a function, in which
case it is called with the same arguments as the builder itself and
should return a string.

Value of `:source-files` parameter must be a <<filesets,fileset>>.  In
the above example, fileset consists of only one simple rule — which is
actually enough in most cases, — but it could also be much more
complicated.  All files that match the fileset and do not match
`eldev-standard-excludes` will be processed using this builder.

Parameter `:targets` defines the rule used to construct target names
out of sources matched by `:source-files`.  There are several ways to
define this rule, we’ll consider them in <<target-rules,their own
subsection>>.

Keyword `:collect` determines how targets generated by this builder
are “collected” into virtual targets.  In the example all such targets
are simply added to the virtual target `:default`.  However, here too
we have several other possibilities, which will be described
<<collecting-virtual-targets,later>>.

Finally, keyword `:define-cleaner` provides a simple way of linking
builders with the <<cleaning,cleaning system>>.

Another important keyword is `:type`.  It is not used here only
because the example builder is of the default and most common type
that generates one target for each source file.  All possible types
are: `one-to-one` (the default), `one-to-many` (several targets from
one source file), `many-to-one` and `many-to-many`.  If you write a
builder of a non-default type, be aware that it will be called with a
list of strings instead of a single string as one or both of its
arguments, as appropriate.  You should probably also name them in
plural in the definition in this case, to avoid confusion.

[#target-rules]
==== Target rules

Target rules define which target(s) will be built from given
source(s).  There are several ways to define a target rule.  Yet more
can be added in the future as real-world needs accumulate.

`TARGET`::

    All the sources will be passed together as a list to the builder
    to generate one `TARGET`.  This is suitable for `many-to-one`
    builders.

`(TARGET-1 [TARGET-2 [\...]])`::

    Build several `TARGETS` out of all the sources.  This is for
    `many-to-many` and `one-to-many` builders.

`(SOURCE-SUFFIX \-> TARGET-SUFFIX)`::

    Build target name from source name by replacing filename suffixes.
    `SOURCE-SUFFIX` can also be a list of strings, in which case any
    suffix from the list will be replaced.  This is the type of target
    rule you can see in the example and is suitable for `one-to-one`
    builders.  Another use of this rule type could be seen in
    byte-compiling builder:
+
        :targets        (".el" -> ".elc")

And the most powerful of all target rules: a function (can be a lambda
form or a function name).  It is called with a list of sources (even
if the builder is of `one-to-one` or `one-to-many` type) and must
return one of the types enumerated above.

[#collecting-virtual-targets]
==== Collecting into virtual targets

Real targets generated by the builders can optionally be combined into
virtual targets.  The latter are used to easily build all real targets
of the same type; some (`:default`, `:compile` etc.)  also have
special meaning to certain commands.

Like with the target rules, there are several ways to collect the
targets.

`VIRTUAL-TARGET`::

    All real targets generated by the builder are combined into given
    `VIRTUAL-TARGET`.  This is what you can see in the example.

`(VIRTUAL-TARGET-1 [VIRTUAL-TARGET-2 [\... VIRTUAL-TARGET-N]])`::

    Combine the real targets into `VIRTUAL-TARGET-N`, then put it to
    the preceding virtual target and so on.  This format is currently
    unused in standard Eldev builders.  It can generate target trees
    of this form:
+
--
    :gen-files
        :gen-sources
            :gen-el
                foo.el.in
                bar.el.in

It is expected (even if not required) that a different builder adds
another branch to the tree, actually making it useful.
--

`(ENTRY...)`, each `ENTRY` being `(REAL-TARGETS VIRTUAL-TARGETS)`::

    Both of `REAL-TARGETS` and `VIRTUAL-TARGETS` must be either a list
    or a single target string.  For each `ENTRY` this repeats the
    logic of one of the two formats above, but instead of all targets
    for the builder uses only those listed in `REAL-TARGETS` for the
    `ENTRY`.  This is not often needed, but can be useful if builder’s
    targets come in two or more substantially different kinds.

Like with <<target-rules,target rules>>, you can specify a function
here.  Such a function gets called with a list of real targets and
must return a collection rule in one of the formats listed above.

==== Summary

To define a builder you need to write an Elisp function that generates
target(s) from source(s).  If it processes multiple sources at once or
generates multiple targets, give it the appropriate `:type`.  Write a
fileset that matches its `:source-files` and a rule to determine
target names from those — parameter `:targets`.  If you want the
targets grouped together into virtual target(s), add `:collect`
keyword.  You should probably also add a `:define-cleaner` that
removes generated targets.

Parameters `:name`, `:short-name`, `:message` and `:briefdoc` are all
fully presentational and thus not very important.  But if you want to
write a nice and polished builder, investigate them too.

=== Adding commands and options

Eldev has lots of standard commands, but sometimes you need to define
yet more.  Commands should generally be defined for things that cannot
be reformulated in terms of building targets.  If a command would just
create a file, e.g. extract documentation from source code, an
additional builder would be more suitable.

Defining a command is not much more complicated than defining a normal
Elisp function:

[source]
----
(eldev-defcommand mypackage-parrot (&rest parameters)
  "Repeat parameters from the command line."
  :parameters     "TEXT-TO-PARROT"
  :aliases        (copycat ape)
  (unless parameters
    (signal 'eldev-wrong-command-usage `(t "Nothing to say")))
  (eldev-output "%s" (mapconcat #'identity parameters " ")))
----

Macro `eldev-defcommand` works much like `defun`, but additionally it
adds the new function to the list of Eldev command handlers.  New
command receives name built from the function name by removing package
prefix.  If that doesn’t produce the needed result in your case
(e.g. if package prefix is two words in your project), you can always
specify name explicitly by using `:command` parameter.  You can also
give your command any number of aliases, as shown above.

Keyword `:parameter` describes what the command expects to see on the
command line.  It is used when invoking `eldev help COMMAND` to
improve documentation: all commands are automatically documented.  The
short one-liner for `eldev help` is derived from the function’s
documentation by taking the first sentence.  If this is not good
enough in your case, use keyword `:briefdoc` to set it explicitly.

When command is invoked from command line, Eldev calls the
corresponding function, passing all remaining parameters to it as
strings.  The example command above just parrots the parameters back
at user, in accordance to its name.

==== Defining options

You have probably noticed that the command function we’ve defined
doesn’t accept any options.  In fact, this is true for all commands in
Eldev: options are not _passed_ to them.  Eldev takes a different
approach: whenever a (recognized) option is encountered on the command
line, appropriate function is called, which is supposed to alter
global state.  This way it is easy to share options between multiple
commands when needed.

So, with that in mind, let’s expand our example command with an
option:

[source]
----
(defvar mypackage-parrot-colorize-as nil)

(eldev-defcommand mypackage-parrot (&rest parameters)
  "Repeat parameters from the command line.  If you want, I can even
colorize them!"
  :parameters     "TEXT-TO-PARROT"
  :aliases        (copycat ape)
  (unless parameters
    (signal 'eldev-wrong-command-usage `(t "Nothing to say")))
  (let ((text (mapconcat #'identity parameters " ")))
     (when mypackage-parrot-colorize-as
       (setf text (eldev-colorize text mypackage-parrot-colorize-as)))
     (eldev-output "%s" text)))

(eldev-defoption mypackage-parrot-colorize (&optional style)
  "Apply given STYLE to the parroted text (`section' if not specified)"
  :options        (-c --colorize)
  :optional-value STYLE
  :for-command    parrot
  (setf mypackage-parrot-colorize-as (intern (or style "section"))))
----

Definition of `mypackage-parrot` is updated, but there is nothing
Eldev-specific here.  Let’s rather have a look at the option
definition.

Unlike for command function, name of option function is not important.
Instead, how the option looks like on the command line is determined
by `:options` keyword.  It can specify any number of alternatives, but
they all must be either short-style (single `-` followed by one
letter) or long-style (`--` followed by a longer name) options.  Some
options take a value; it is determined by parameter `:optional-value`
or `:value` (if the value is mandatory) and must match arguments in
function definition.

Options can be either global or command-specific.  In the latter case
— the one you’ll typically need — you define to which command(s) the
option applies using `:for-command` parameter.  In our case its value
is a single command, but it can also be a list of commands.

To test how the new option works, run:

    $ eldev parrot -c Repeat this

It should print text “Repeat this” in bold, unless you’ve disabled
output colorizing.

Note that the command doesn’t repeat “-c”, even though it appears on
the command line.  That’s because Eldev doesn’t pass the options as
parameters to commands: only non-option arguments remain.

Documentation (i.e. output of `eldev help parrot`) for the command we
defined above now automatically lists the accepted option:

....
Usage: eldev [OPTION...] parrot TEXT-TO-PARROT

Command aliases: copycat, ape

Options:
  -c, --colorize[=STYLE]
                        Apply given STYLE to the parroted text (‘section’ if
                        not specified)

Repeat parameters from the command line.  If you want, I can even
colorize them!
....

=== Custom test runners

FIXME


== Influential environment variables

A few environment variables can affect Eldev’s behavior.

`EMACS` or `ELDEV_EMACS`::

    Use given Emacs executable (also for any child processes).  If not
    specified, this defaults to just `emacs`, which is expected
    somewhere in `$PATH`.

`ELDEV_LOCAL`::

    Load Eldev Elisp code from given directory (usually a Git clone of
    source tree) instead of the normal bootstrapping from MELPA.
    Should not be needed normally, only when developing Eldev itself.

`ELDEV_DIR`::

    Directory where user’s configuration file, Eldev’s bootstrapping
    files etc. are located, defaults to `~/.eldev`.  Used by Eldev’s
    own regression tests, should be of no interest for typical use.

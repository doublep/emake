                              FILES HERE

common.el

    Not a test file, but contains common utilities needed by many
    other files.

*.el

    Actual ERT tests.  Most files are named after Eldev commands they
    test.

integration/*.el

    ERT tests that involve third-party tools: linters, testing
    frameworks etc.

files/

    Nested tree of variously named files and directories used in
    fileset tests.

package-archive-*/

    Used to look up dependencies for tests projects and not ping MELPA
    or something like that all the time.  Not having to look up real
    packages in the internet speeds testing up considerably and also
    makes results more predictable, because real packages in real
    archives could change.

org-pseudoarchive/

    Archive emulating Org snapshot archive, used to test that Eldev
    knows how to install more recent versions of built-in packages.

dependency-*/

    Test "projects" also available from the local test archives above.
    Used to test local sources.

missing-dependency-*/

    Projects that don't provide a way to look up at least one
    dependency.  Can only be repaired using local sources.  Used to
    test that certain Eldev commands work anyway.

*/

    Various other test "projects" of varying complexity.
